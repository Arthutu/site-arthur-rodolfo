## Introduction

This project was built using Astro and Tailwind CSS. It is hosted on Vercel.

This README will provide you with essential information about the project structure and how to set up your development environment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
/
|-- src/
|   |-- assets/
|   |-- components/
|   |-- i18n/
|   |-- layouts/
|   |-- pages/
```

-   **src/components**: Images and videos used in the projects page as well as the the picture from the home.

-   **src/components**: This directory contains reusable components used throughout the website.

-   **src/components**: i18n translations and util functions.

-   **src/layouts**: Layouts define the structure of your pages.

-   **src/pages**: Each `.astro` file in this directory represents a webpage. The file structure mirrors the site's URL structure.
